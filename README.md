# Spendr – Expense Tracker 💰

A minimalist expense tracker with dark mode, monthly charts, and local storage support.

## 🌟 The Story Behind Spendr

I created **Spendr** after searching for a simple, ad-free expense tracker and realizing that most apps were either overloaded with features, locked behind paywalls, or full of ads. I wanted something clean, fast, and distraction-free — just a tool to track what I earn and spend, without selling my data or crowding my screen.

**Spendr** is my take on that — a lightweight, responsive tracker built entirely with vanilla JavaScript, designed for students, freelancers, and minimalists like myself who want clarity over clutter.
